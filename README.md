onCreate() -> when android first creates the activity

onStart() -> when activity starts and android invokes callback,it makes the activity visible to the user

onResume() -> when activity enters a resumed state, this is the state in which the app interacts with the user.

onStop() -> when activity is no longer visible to the user

onRestart() -> when the activity either comes back to interact with user or finish running

onDestroy() -> when the activity ends

# Android studio

Gradle is kind of a compiler which builds the android project

To make a project just go to file>new project>empty view activity>write all the stuff>finish

iv) in drawable we have images
